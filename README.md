# Random pacman


This HTML and JavaScript code creates an interactive "Pacman" animation where users can add multiple Pacman characters to a designated blue container. 
By clicking the "Add Pacman" button, new Pacman images are randomly positioned within the container with randomized velocities.
The "Start Game" button initiates movement, causing each Pacman to bounce off the container edges while changing images based on their direction.
Ensure that the image paths for PacMan1.png, PacMan2.png, PacMan3.png, and PacMan4.png are correctly set for proper display.
Further enhancements, such as score tracking or advanced animations, can be implemented for additional features.
